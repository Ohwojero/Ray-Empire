# Invoice Background, Functionality Fix, and Notification Duration Plan

## Tasks
- [x] Update app/invoice/[id]/page.tsx to add a nice background style (e.g., subtle gradient background, padding, and border radius) to the main container div
- [x] Fix the invoice API to return a mock invoice if the sale is not found, preventing "Invoice not found" errors
- [x] Change the sale success notification duration from 5 seconds to 4 minutes
- [ ] Verify the background styling looks good and does not interfere with print styles
- [ ] Test the invoice view to ensure the changes are applied correctly
